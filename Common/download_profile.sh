# A wrapper around Cupertino https://github.com/mattt/cupertino which allows for automated
# downloads of named provisioning profiles.
#
# Compatible with cupertino 1.0.1 (ios 1.0.1)
#
# If the DEV_USER and DEV_PASSWORD environment variables are availalbe, we will use these
# credentials to authenticate with the Apple Developer system. If not, then it is assumed
# `ios login` has previously been performed and the needed credentials are already stored
# in the calling user's Keychain.
#
# NOTE: This assumes the calling user's Keychain is unlocked.
